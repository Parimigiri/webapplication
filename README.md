TITLE: AI-Powered Pest Control System for Sustainable Agriculture .
====================================================================

STEP 1: Problem Addressed: Traditional pest control methods are often inefficient, leading to delayed pest detection, significant crop damage, reduced yields, and environmental degradation due to excessive use of pesticides

======================================================================================================================================
STYEP 2:Proposed Solution: The project introduces an intelligent pest management system that utilizes AI-driven image classification.

======================================================================================================================================
STEP 3: Technology Used: The system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including pre-trained models like ResNet, for accurate pest identification. Optimization methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are applied to maximize detection rates.

======================================================================================================================================
STEP 4:Implementation: The solution is developed as a user-friendly web application using frameworks like Gradio or Flask, making it accessible to farmers without requiring additional hardware.

===========================================================================================================================================
Data and Deployment: The CNN models are trained using a diverse dataset of pest images from Kaggle. The application is hosted on cloud-based platforms such as Heroku or Railway.app to ensure ease of access and remote monitoring for farmers.
